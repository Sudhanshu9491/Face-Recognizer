# Face Recognition with Name Display

This project is a **Python-based face recognition system** that detects faces in images and displays the corresponding name on them. It utilizes **OpenCV** for face detection and **machine learning models** for face recognition.

## 🚀 Features
- Detects faces from images.
- Recognizes known faces and displays their names.
- Supports training new faces for recognition.
- Uses **OpenCV** for face detection and **machine learning models** for recognition.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Face Recognition Library 
- Machine Learning Model

## 🔧 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sudhanshu9491/Face-Recognizer.git
   cd Face-Recognizer
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-contrib-python
   ```
3. Run the face recognition script:
   ```bash
   python testing.py
   ```

## 📷 Usage
- Add images of known people in the `image/` folder.
- Train the model using `detectFace.py`.
- Run the main script to detect and recognize faces.
